<Callout>First whole-school AI CPD → practical, safe, and confidence-building</Callout>

## Problem
Staff were hearing about AI but had no trusted guidance on how to use it. Risk of confusion, shadow-use, and fear was growing.

## Context & Diagnosis
AI was emerging rapidly in education. Leaders needed a safe, structured introduction before rumours and poor practices embedded.

## Intervention
I designed and delivered the first AI CPD session for all staff:
- Grounded in real classroom tasks.  
- Balanced risks with opportunities.  
- Focused on practical “use it tomorrow” examples.  

## Results
- 100% of teaching staff trained.  
- Positive shift from suspicion → curiosity.  
- Early adoption by senior leaders for drafting reports and planning.  

## What I’d do differently
- Include follow-up clinics sooner.  
- Capture more baseline data on AI perceptions before launch.  

## Standards & Evidence
Mapped to ISO 42001 for AI governance and CMI Level 7 competencies in leadership, training, and change enablement.
