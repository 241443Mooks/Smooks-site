<Callout>Student-built, zero-budget, region-wide: culture shift measured, not claimed.</Callout>

## Problem
Recognition was ad-hoc and invisible; no mechanism to surface peer-to-peer appreciation or quantify culture signals. Fragmented forms, manual collation, no feedback loops.

## Context & Diagnosis
- Stakeholders: Regional Director, Heads, Marketing, HR, Teachers, Students  
- Systems: Microsoft Forms → Power Automate → SharePoint List → Power BI  
- Root causes: tool sprawl, no system owner, no metrics, no single source of truth.

## Intervention
1. SharePoint List as the system backbone (schema + ownership).  
2. Power Automate flows for submission → moderation → publish → notify.  
3. Power BI dashboard with participation KPIs and trend lines.  
4. Playbook + comms pack; student team to operate the pipeline.

## Results
- 90% staff participation in 4 weeks; 1,147 nominations; 312 peer recognitions.  
- Leaders gained weekly insight into momentum, departments, and role models.  
- Handover to Marketing for ongoing stewardship.

## What I’d do differently
Add a lightweight taxonomy for values, and ship an auto-generated monthly report PDF.

## Standards & Evidence
Aligned to ISO 20000-1 (service design & transition), ISO 27001 (access control), GDPR Art. 5 (data minimisation). Evidence mapped to CMI L7 Units 700, 703, 714.
