**Context**  
Recognition felt top‑down and distrusted. Brief was vague. We wireframed end‑to‑end, tested an MVP in a separate tenant, and anchored engagement on **peer nominations** to rebuild trust.

**Action**  
- Information architecture + comms flow (how people hear, access, nominate).  
- Power Automate + Lists + SharePoint front-end.  
- Transparent shortlisting & winner selection mechanics.  
- Risk + failure modes rehearsed; relentless pre‑flight testing.

**Outcome / Value**  
- High trust, high participation; students gained real systems‑delivery experience.  
- Reusable blueprint for future cultural change projects.

**CMI mapping**: 705 (Strategic Change), 703 (Collaboration), 701 (Strategic Leadership).
