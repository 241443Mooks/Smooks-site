*Avoiding hard truths drains more than facing them.*

## Introduction
In every organisation, there are issues everyone sees but few dare to raise. People avoid the discomfort, hoping silence will keep the peace. But silence doesn’t come free — it accumulates cost. Unspoken problems turn into wasted resources, broken trust, and lost momentum.

## Key Insights

### The price of silence is hidden but heavy
Unnamed problems don’t disappear. They multiply quietly until they erupt.  

### Directness can be safe
Leaders can learn to surface elephants with honesty *and* empathy, preserving relationships while reducing damage.  

### Avoidance drains credibility
A leader who never names the issue loses authority, even if their intentions are good.  

## Lesson
Naming the elephant isn’t reckless — it’s responsible. Done with care, it strengthens both the room and the results.
