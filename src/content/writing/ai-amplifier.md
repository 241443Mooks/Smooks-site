*Technology doesn’t solve problems. It magnifies them.*

## Introduction
Every time a new technology arrives, organisations scramble to adopt it as a cure-all. But AI won’t fix broken processes. It doesn’t erase poor leadership or muddled systems — it shines a spotlight on them. Used well, AI can accelerate clarity; used poorly, it amplifies chaos.

## Key Insights

### AI multiplies what already exists
If your workflows are clear, AI streamlines them. If they’re fragmented, AI spreads the fragmentation faster.  

### The bottleneck is design, not tech
Many leaders think adoption is the hard part. In reality, the challenge is system design: building processes that are resilient enough to benefit from automation.  

### Amplification is neutral
AI doesn’t care whether it boosts value or waste. That choice is entirely ours.  

## Lesson
AI is best understood as an amplifier. Leaders who focus on clarity first will find AI accelerates progress; those who skip that step risk accelerating dysfunction.
