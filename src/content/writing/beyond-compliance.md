*Policies should protect and enable — not just tick boxes.*

## Introduction
Too often, policies are written as static documents that stifle more than they safeguard. In the AI era, this approach is unsustainable. Risk evolves faster than paper can keep up. Compliance still matters — but policy must move from rigid instruction to adaptive guidance that makes sense in practice.

## Key Insights

### Tick-box compliance isn’t enough
A policy that no one reads or understands is as dangerous as having no policy at all.

### Good policy is lived, not filed
Rules must be written in plain language and aligned with real workflows.  

### AI requires adaptive governance
Static controls won’t protect against dynamic risks. Policy has to flex with both opportunity and threat.  

## Lesson
Leaders must rebuild policy as a framework for decision-making, not a cage. Done well, governance becomes a source of confidence, not constraint.
