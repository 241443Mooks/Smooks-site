title: "Beyond Compliance: Rebuilding Policy for the Age of AI"
slug: "beyond-compliance"
date: "2024-04-18"
summary: "When done well, a policy does more than set expectations. It creates confidence. It reduces ambiguity, builds trust, and helps people make decisions without fear of misstepping. In a climate where AI decisions can shape outcomes, perceptions, and even careers, this matters.

A policy is not an obstacle. It is a lens.

And it is time we started writing them that way."
