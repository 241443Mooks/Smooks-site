## The Metaphor
Rome is a single city with strong walls; the Empire is a federation of cities connected by roads. Schools often build “another Rome” each time they adopt a tool. This playbook shows how to build roads.

## Principles (Checklist)
- Single source of truth  
- Event-driven automation  
- Explicit governance models  

## How to Use
1. Map your systems as cities and roads.  
2. Choose your “imperial standards” (data model, identity, integration).  
3. Define change control and who wears which RACI hat.  
4. Pilot one road, then templatise it.

> Tip: Pair this with the **RACI Hats Framework** to keep ownership clear as the empire grows.
