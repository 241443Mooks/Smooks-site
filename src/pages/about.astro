    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      I’m Sharron “SMooks” Mooks — a strategic, systems-focused education leader. I design and deliver scalable,
      human-centred systems: SharePoint/365 platforms, AI policy and governance, ISO-aligned frameworks, and the kind
      of operational clarity that frees people to do their best work.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      I’ve led student-built, region-wide platforms (like a staff recognition system with 1,147 nominations across 7 schools),
      created high‑impact timetables, and authored responsible AI policy adopted group‑wide. My approach: integrity first,
      clarity always, measurable outcomes.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      Beyond work, I coach and mentor, love big landscapes, and believe culture changes when systems do.
